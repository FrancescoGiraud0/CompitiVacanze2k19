#   Study Drills
#   1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the
#   year 2010 in ”January 1, 2010,” really is 2010 and not 2009? (Hint: you can’t pick years at random.)
#   >  Because it's been 2010 years since year zero.
#   2. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
#   3. Use Python to check your answers.
