#   Study Drills
#   1. There are a lot of operators in Python similar to != and == . Try to find as many ”equality operators”
#   as you can. They should be like < or <= .
#   2. Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For example, I call != ”not equal.”
#      >        "greater"
#      >=       "greater or equal"
#      <        "lower"
#      <=       "lower or equal"
#      ==       "equal"
#      !=       "not equal"
#      & / and  "and"
#      | / or   "or"
#   3. Play with Python by typing out new Boolean operators, and before you press Enter try to shout
#   out what it is. Do not think about it. Shout the first thing that comes to mind. Write it down,
#   then press Enter, and keep track of how many you get right and wrong.
#   4. Throw away the piece of paper from 3 so you do not accidentally try to use it later.
