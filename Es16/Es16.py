#Study Drills
#   1. If you do not understand this, go back through and use the comment trick to get it squared away
#   in your mind. One simple English comment above each line will help you understand or at least
#   let you know what you need to research more.
#   2. Write a script similar to the last exercise that uses read and argv to read the file you just created.
#   3. There’s too much repetition in this file. Use strings, formats, and escapes to print out line1 , line2 ,
#   and line3 with just one target.write() command instead of six.
#   4. Find out why we had to pass a 'w' as an extra parameter to open . Hint: open tries to be safe by
#   making you explicitly say you want to write a file.
#   > Python does not allow to modify a file without a specify our intents.
#   5. If you open the file with 'w' mode, then do you really need the target.truncate() ? Read the
#   documentation for Python’s open function and see if that’s true.
#   > No, I don't. Bacause when a file is opened in write mode is truncated when it is opened if already exist.
