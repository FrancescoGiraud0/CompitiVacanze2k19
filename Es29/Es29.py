#   Study Drills
#   1. What do you think the if does to the code under it?
#   >  The if struct is used to verify a condition.
#   2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented four spaces?
#   >  Because it's the code that will be runned if the condition is True.
#   3. What happens if it isn’t indented?7
#   >  If the code it is not idented, the code under the if will be always runned, so the
#      if condition becomes useless.
#   4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement ? Try it.
#   5. What happens if you change the initial values for people , cats , and dogs ?
#   >  Outputs could be different.
