#   Study Drills:
#   1. If you aren’t really sure what return does, try writing a few of your own functions and have them
#   return some values. You can return anything that you can put to the right of an = .
#   2. At the end of the script is a puzzle. I’m taking the return value of one function and using it as the
#   argument of another function. I’m( doing this in a chain so that I’m kind of creating a formula using
#   the functions. It looks really weird, but if you run the script, you can see the results. What you
#   should do is try to figure out the normal formula that would recreate this same set of operations.
#   >   what = age + (height - (weight * (iq/2)))
#   3. Once you have the formula worked out for the puzzle, get in there and see what happens when
#   you modify the parts of the functions. Try to change it on purpose to make another value.
#   4. Do the inverse. Write a simple formula and use the functions in the same way to calculate it.
