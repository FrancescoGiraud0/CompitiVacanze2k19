#   Breaking It
#   1. Find strings of text encoded in other encodings and place them in the ex23.py file to see how it
#   breaks.
#   > I copied a chinese word encoded in big5 encoding at the end of "languages.txt". I tried to decode/encode it
#   in utf-8 and big5 encoding but neither "recognize" the word. But... using the script to solve the point 3,
#   it's possible read the word.
#   2. Find out what happens when you give an encoding that doesn’t exist.
#   > Python recognize that the encoding does not exists, stop the program and print some errors.
#   3. Extra challenging: Rewrite this using the b'' bytes instead of the UTF-8 strings, effectively reversing
#   the script. bytes instead of the UTF-8 strings, effectively reversing
#   the script.
#   > Es23_BreakingIt3.py
#   4. If you can do that, then you can also break these bytes by removing some to see what happens.
#   How much do you need to remove to cause Python to break? How much can you remove to
#   damage the string output but pass Python’s decoding system.
#   5. Use what you learned from #4 to see if you can mangle the files. What errors do you get? How
#   much damage can you cause and get the file past Python’s decoding system?
