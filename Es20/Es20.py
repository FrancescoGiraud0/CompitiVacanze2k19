#Study Drills
#   1. Write English comments for each line to understand what that line does.
#   2. Each time print_a_line is run, you are passing in a variable current_line . Write out what cur-
#   rent_line is equal to on each function call, and trace how it becomes line_count in print_a_line .
#   3. Find each place a function is used, and check its def to make sure that you are giving it the right
#   arguments.
#   4. Research online what the seek function for file does. Try pydoc file , and see if you can figure
#   it out from there. Then try pydoc file.seek to see what seek does.
#   5. Research the shorthand notation += , and rewrite the script to use += instead.
