#   Study Drills
#   1. Try to guess what elif and else are doing.
#   >  Elif is used to check another condition if the first condition isn't True.
#      Else is used to run a piece of code if previous conditions are not True.
#   2. Change the numbers of cars , people , and trucks , and then trace through each if-statement
#      to see what will be printed.
#   >  people = 60; cars = 40; trucks = 70
#      We should not take the cars.
#      That's too many trucks.
#      Fine, let's stay home then.
#   3. Try some more complex boolean expressions like cars > people or trucks < cars .
#   4. Above each line write an English description of what the line does.
