#   Study Drills
#   1. Write some more songs using this and make sure you understand that you’re passing a list of
#   strings as the lyrics.
#   2. Put the lyrics in a separate variable, then pass that variable to the class to use instead.
#   3. See if you can hack on this and make it do more things. Don’t worry if you have no idea how, just
#   give it a try, see what happens. Break it, trash it, thrash it, you can’t hurt it.
#   4. Search online for ”object-oriented programming” and try to overflow your brain with what you
#   read. Don’t worry if it makes absolutely no sense to you. Half of that stuff makes no sense to me
#   too.
